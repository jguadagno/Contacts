# Database Scripts

You can find the set up scripts for both [SQL Server](#sql-server) and [Sqlite](#sqlite) below. 
Once you chose the database to use you need to configure the application to use it.
Check out the [readme](../README.md) for more info.

## SQL Server

To use Microsoft SQL Server, you will need to install [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) for local development.
See the file [/sqlserver/readme.md](./sqlserver/readme.md) for steps to set up the database.

## Sqlite

To use SQLite, you will need to install [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for local development.
See the file [/db-scripts/sqlite/readme.md](./sqlite/readme.md) for steps to set up the database.
