# Contacts

This repository is being used for the stream ***Coding with JoeG***. Follow the stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jguadagno).  

We'll follow the development flow [outlined here](outline.md) for content for the stream. The stream and outline will have us build a brand new application to manage and view your contacts.  I know, we have our phones for that, but everyone should understand the basic needs of the application. You should be able to following along with the stream as we go.
